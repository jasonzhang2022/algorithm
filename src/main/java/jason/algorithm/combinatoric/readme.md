+ combination with repetition: We have k stars and n-1 bar. The n-1 bar partitions the k starts in n slots. The number of stars at slot i gives the number of i<sup>th</sup> element in one combination. 
+ Combination **without** repetition can be viewed as a special case of combination with repetition.
  + Each element can appear **0 to k** time for k combination of n elements for combination **with** repetition
  + Each element can appear **0 to 1** time for k combination of n elements for combination **without** repetition
